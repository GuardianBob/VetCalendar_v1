# Running on Nginx server:
The year/month/user variables in the URL will cause a 404 error on Nginx. 
To correct this add a location block to the "appname.domain.com.conf" file located in /etc/nginx/sites-available
Add the following somewhere in the server block:
location / {
    root /path/to/your/app;  # replace with the actual path to your Quasar app
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
